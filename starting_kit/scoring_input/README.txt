This directory shows how things would look like on the server:
- the prediction results end up in the “res” directory 
- the reference “solutions” are in the “ref” directory

The participants can submit results on both the validation and test data.
The scoring program scores the results for the solutions of the datasest available in the corresponding phase (typically the validation set in phase 1 and the test set in phase 2).
